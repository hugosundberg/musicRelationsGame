        <p>
          As of November 2024, Spotify has deprecated the Related Artist API
          endpoint, effectively causing this app to lose its core functionality.
          If Spotify decides to re-enable the endpoint, this app will be up and
          running again! Feel free to visit my{" "}
          <a href="https://hugosundberg.github.io/hugo/">portfolio website</a> to try out
          my other apps!
        </p>
        <h2>Welcome!</h2>

          When the game starts you will be prompted with a selection of artists.

          few guesses as possible.
